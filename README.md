# Azure End to End Data Engineering Pipeline

## 🎯 Project Overview

-This project creates a complete Azure Data Engineering solution that handles data ingestion, ETL, and analytics in one pipeline using Microsoft Azure services and Power BI. 
-The main goal is to move an on-premises database, like Microsoft SQL Server Management System (SSMS), to the cloud. This is done by building an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics.
-The solution also connects to Microsoft Power BI for easy data visualization and reporting through a dashboard.
