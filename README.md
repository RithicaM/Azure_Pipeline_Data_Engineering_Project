# Azure End to End Data Engineering Pipeline

## üéØ **Project Overview**

- This project creates a complete Azure Data Engineering solution that handles data ingestion, ETL, and analytics in one pipeline using Microsoft Azure services and Power BI. 
- The main goal is to move an on-premises database, like Microsoft SQL Server Management System (SSMS), to the cloud. This is done by building an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics.
- The solution also connects to Microsoft Power BI for easy data visualization and reporting through a dashboard.

## üìö **Dataset**
### AdventureWorks Dataset

- **Data Source**: SQL Server
- **Orchestration**: Azure Data Factory
- **Ingestion**: Azure Data Lake Gen2
- **Storage**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Security & Governance**: Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vault

## üì© Data Ingestion
-Established a connection between the on-premises SQL Server and Azure using Microsoft Integration Runtime.

-Set up a Resource Group with necessary services like Key Vault, Storage Account, Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics.

-Transferred tables from the on-premises SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## üõ† Data Transformation
- Mounted Azure Blob Storage in Databricks to access the raw data from the Data Lake.
- Used a Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks to transform the data following the Medallion Architecture, moving it from the Bronze stage to Silver and then to Gold.
- Saved the final, refined data in Delta format, optimized for further analysis.

## üì• Data Loading
- Utilized Azure Synapse Analytics to efficiently load the refined "gold" level data.
- Created a SQL database connected to the data lake and ran an Azure Synapse Pipeline.
- The pipeline retrieves table names from the gold folder and executes a stored procedure for each table, which creates and updates views in the Azure SQL Database.

## üìä Data Reporting
- Loaded data from views into Microsoft Power BI using DirectQuery, allowing automatic updates from cloud pipelines.
- Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse and used database views to create interactive and insightful data visualizations.
